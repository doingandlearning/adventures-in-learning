# Adventures In Learning
> Tackle your learning experiences like you'd slay a dragon - one adventure at a time!

## Background
As [someone who needs a map to learn](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-map-for-web-development/) and who loves to think of learning as an adventure, I want to be able to track my learning and invite other people on my quests. 

Initially this will be single player mode but it could develop into a platform to create and manage your [knowledge adventure clubs](https://joelhooks.com/knowledge-adventure-club).

This project is created as part of a Learning Club with [egghead](https://egghead.io) around state management. I'm going to be building with Vue and trying to learn and leverage XState.

## Technologies used
- Vue 3
- XState


## Functionality
- Pre-created maps:
  - View and interact with a map of a region (large topic area)
  - Select a town in the region (specific topic)
  - View list of adventures within the town (resources: videos/articles/exercises)
  - Defeat the boss in a town (capstone project)
